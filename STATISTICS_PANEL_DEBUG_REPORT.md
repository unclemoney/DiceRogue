# Statistics Panel Debug Report

## Summary
Investigation into Statistics Panel display issues revealed the system is **correctly configured** but may have visibility or input handling problems in specific scenarios.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY**
1. **Instantiation**: StatisticsPanel is properly instantiated in scene tree
2. **Scene Structure**: Panel exists at `../StatisticsPanel` relative to GameController  
3. **Input Mapping**: F10 input is handled via `_unhandled_input()` in GameController
4. **Scene Configuration**: StatisticsPanel.tscn is correctly added to main scene (DebuffTest.tscn)
5. **Statistics Manager**: Autoload is working and providing data
6. **Panel Dimensions**: 1100x500 pixels, z-index 1000, centered positioning

### üîç **POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

#### 1. Input Processing Conflicts
- Multiple `_input()` and `_unhandled_input()` handlers in test scenes
- F10 might be consumed by another node before reaching GameController

#### 2. Visibility Debugging Needed
- Panel may be toggling but not visible due to styling issues
- Need to verify actual visibility state when F10 is pressed

#### 3. Scene Context Dependencies
- System tested primarily in DebuffTest.tscn (current main scene)
- May behave differently in other scenes or editor context

## Debug Steps Added

### Enhanced Logging
Added debug output to both GameController and StatisticsPanel:
- `[GameController] F10 key detected - toggling statistics panel`
- `[StatisticsPanel] toggle_visibility called - current visible: false`
- `[StatisticsPanel] After toggle - visible: true`

## Editor Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Verify Scene Structure**
1. Open `Tests/DebuffTest.tscn` in Godot editor
2. Confirm scene tree shows:
   ```
   Node2D (Root)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GameController
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StatisticsPanel
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other nodes...]
   ```
3. Select StatisticsPanel node and verify:
   - **Script**: `res://Scripts/UI/statistics_panel.gd`
   - **Visible**: `false` (starts hidden)
   - **Z Index**: `1000`
   - **Z As Relative**: `false`

### **Step 2: Test F10 Input Detection**
1. Run the main scene (`Tests/DebuffTest.tscn`)
2. Open the Console/Output panel in Godot
3. Press F10 key
4. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   [GameController] F10 key detected - toggling statistics panel
   [GameController] _toggle_statistics_panel called
   [GameController] StatisticsPanel found, current visibility: false
   [StatisticsPanel] toggle_visibility called - current visible: false
   [StatisticsPanel] After toggle - visible: true
   [StatisticsPanel] Making panel visible - z_index: 1000
   [StatisticsPanel] Panel should now be visible with timer started
   [GameController] After toggle, visibility: true
   ```

### **Step 3: Visual Verification**
If you see the debug output but no panel:

1. **Check Panel Positioning**:
   - Panel should appear in center of screen (1100x500 pixels)
   - Semi-transparent gray background with white text
   - Tabbed interface with 6 tabs: Core, Economic, Dice, Hands, Items, Session

2. **Verify Z-Index Issues**:
   - Panel has z-index 1000 to appear above other UI
   - If still not visible, try pressing F10 twice (might be behind other elements)

3. **Alternative Test**:
   - Select StatisticsPanel in scene tree
   - In Inspector, check "Visible" property manually
   - Panel should appear immediately

### **Step 4: Input Conflict Resolution**
If F10 not detected in console:

1. **Check Input Node Priority**:
   - Ensure no other nodes have higher input priority
   - GameController should receive `_unhandled_input` calls

2. **Test Alternative Key**:
   - Temporarily change `KEY_F10` to `KEY_F9` in game_controller.gd
   - Test if different key works

3. **Scene Context Test**:
   - Create minimal test scene with just GameController and StatisticsPanel
   - Test F10 input in isolated environment

### **Step 5: Fallback Manual Test**
If automatic toggle fails, test manually:

1. **Via Script**:
   ```gdscript
   # In game_controller.gd _ready() function, add:
   if statistics_panel:
       statistics_panel.visible = true
   ```

2. **Via Inspector**:
   - Select StatisticsPanel node
   - Check "Visible" in Inspector
   - Verify panel appears with populated data

## Expected Behavior
When working correctly:
- F10 shows/hides statistics panel
- Panel displays 6 tabs with real-time game data
- Panel appears centered with semi-transparent background
- Console shows debug messages confirming input detection
- Panel updates every second while visible

## Quick Fixes

### If Panel Appears But No Data:
- Statistics autoload might not be initialized
- Check console for `[StatisticsPanel] WARNING: Statistics autoload not found!`

### If F10 Detected But Panel Not Visible:
- Panel might be positioned off-screen or behind other UI
- Try manually setting `visible = true` in Inspector

### If No F10 Detection:
- Another node consuming input
- Try alternative key or check scene structure

## Files Modified
- `Scripts/Core/game_controller.gd` - Added F10 debug logging  
- `Scripts/UI/statistics_panel.gd` - Added visibility debug logging
- Created debug test scenes for comprehensive testing

## Conclusion
The Statistics Panel system is architecturally sound. Issues are likely related to:
1. Input event consumption by other nodes
2. UI visibility/positioning problems  
3. Scene-specific context requirements
