# Statistics System

## Overview
The Statistics system tracks all player actions and game metrics throughout their play session. This data will be used for:
- Player analytics and progress tracking
- Dynamic power-ups and consumables that scale with player behavior
- Debug information and game balance analysis
- Future achievements and unlocks system

## Statistics Categories

### Economic Metrics
- `total_money_earned`: All money gained from scoring
- `total_money_spent`: All money spent in shops
- `money_spent_on_powerups`: Subset of total spent
- `money_spent_on_consumables`: Subset of total spent
- `money_spent_on_mods`: Subset of total spent
- `current_money`: Player's current money amount

### Dice Metrics
- `dice_rolled_by_color`: Dictionary tracking rolls per dice color

- `consumables_purchased`: Total consumables bought
- `mods_purchased`: Total mods bought
- `powerups_used`: Total power-ups activated
- `consumables_used`: Total consumables consumed

### Session Metrics
- `session_start_time`: When current session began
- `total_play_time`: Cumulative play time in seconds
- `highest_score`: Best score achieved in session
- `longest_streak`: Longest consecutive scoring streak

## Architecture

### StatisticsManager (Autoload Singleton)
**Path**: `Scripts/Managers/statistics_manager.gd`
- Extends Node, configured as autoload named "Statistics"
- Tracks all statistics in real-time
- Provides getter/setter methods for each statistic
- Emits signals when significant milestones are reached
- Handles persistence (save/load) of statistics

### StatisticsUI Panel
**Path**: `Scenes/UI/StatisticsPanel.tscn` & `Scripts/UI/statistics_panel.gd`
- Toggle visibility with F10 key
- Tabbed interface showing different statistic categories
- Real-time updates while panel is visible
- Clean, readable formatting with proper labels

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **StatisticsManager autoload singleton** - Fully implemented and active
- **Basic statistic storage and retrieval** - All core metrics tracked
- **Increment/decrement methods** - Complete API for all statistics
- **Session timing functionality** - Tracks play time and session data
- **Dice rolling system integration** - Connected to dice roll events
- **Scoring system integration** - Tracks hand completions and scores
- **Shop system integration** - Tracks purchases and spending
- **Power-up and consumable usage tracking** - Full item usage statistics
- **Money management integration** - Comprehensive economic tracking
- **StatisticsPanel UI** - F10 toggle with tabbed interface
- **Real-time updates** - Live refreshing while panel is visible
- **Dice lock tracking** - Connected to dice_hand.die_locked signal
- **Detailed logbook system** - Complete hand scoring history with modifiers

### ðŸ”§ Recent Bug Fixes
- **Dice Color Tracking**: Fixed case sensitivity issues in color normalization
- **Duplicate Hand Scoring**: Eliminated double counting in score button handling  
- **Poor House Autoscoring**: Fixed bonus persistence after manual scoring
- **Logbook Source Attribution**: Enhanced calculation summaries with specific source details
- **Dice Lock Statistics**: Connected die_locked signal to statistics tracking

## Implementation TODO List

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add milestone detection and celebration
- [ ] Implement statistic-based power-up conditions
- [ ] Add export functionality for debugging
- [ ] Create reset functionality for testing
- [ ] Add persistence system for cross-session tracking

### Phase 5: Power-Up Integration
- [ ] Create power-ups that scale with roll count
- [ ] Add consumables that trigger on specific statistics
- [ ] Implement achievements based on statistic thresholds
- [ ] Create dynamic difficulty scaling based on player performance

## API Design

### Key Methods
```gdscript
# Increment counters
Statistics.increment_turns()
Statistics.increment_rolls()
Statistics.increment_money_spent(amount)

# Track dice behavior
Statistics.track_dice_roll(color, value)
Statistics.track_dice_lock()

# Record hand completions
Statistics.record_hand_scored(hand_type, score)

# Get current values
Statistics.get_total_rolls()
Statistics.get_money_efficiency()
Statistics.get_favorite_dice_color()

# Advanced queries
Statistics.get_scoring_percentage()
Statistics.get_average_score_per_hand()
```

### Signals
```gdscript
# Milestone achievements
signal milestone_reached(milestone_name: String, value: int)
signal new_record_set(statistic_name: String, new_value)
signal session_summary_ready(summary_data: Dictionary)
```
