# Refactor TODO List

This document tracks the progress of refactoring efforts for the DiceRogue project.

## Refactor Items Assessment

### 1. Score Modifier Manager Naming & API
- **Status**: ‚ùå Not Needed
- **Issue**: File is `MultiplierManager.gd` but referenced as `ScoreModifierManager` in code
- **Assessment**: Actually WELL DESIGNED! The file is correctly named and the class_name is properly commented out per autoload guidelines. The autoload name "ScoreModifierManager" in project.godot provides the correct API name while keeping the file name descriptive.
- **Action**: No changes needed - current design is optimal.

### 2. Power-up API Consistency
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Further Review
- **Issue**: Power-ups may inconsistently use ScoreModifierManager API
- **Assessment**: Found significant boilerplate duplication in power-ups. All three reviewed power-ups have nearly identical code for connecting to ScoreModifierManager. However, they all properly use the register/unregister API consistently.
- **Action**: Consider creating a base PowerUp class to reduce boilerplate, but API usage is already consistent.

### 3. UI Card Construction Extraction
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed - Needs Refactoring
- **Issue**: Repeated UI creation code across ConsumableIcon, PowerUpIcon, ChallengeIcon
- **Assessment**: SIGNIFICANT duplication found! All three classes have nearly identical `_create_card_structure()` methods with 95% similar code. This is a clear candidate for extraction.
- **Action**: Create a shared CardIconBase class or helper to eliminate duplication.

### 4. Spine/Fanned UI Duplication
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed - Needs Refactoring  
- **Issue**: PowerUpUI and ConsumableUI share spine/fan system logic
- **Assessment**: MASSIVE duplication found! Both classes have nearly identical: `_create_background()`, `_create_spine_tooltip()`, spine positioning logic, fan layout calculations, animation systems, and state management. This is ~70% duplicate code.
- **Action**: Create a shared SpineFanUIBase class to eliminate this significant duplication.

### 5. Signal Connect/Disconnect Patterns
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed - Needs Refactoring
- **Issue**: Power-ups repeat signal lifecycle boilerplate
- **Assessment**: EXTENSIVE boilerplate found! Every power-up has nearly identical patterns for: checking `is_connected()`, connecting signals, `_on_tree_exiting()` cleanup, and ScoreModifierManager connection code. This is prime candidate for a base PowerUp class.
- **Action**: Create PowerUpBase class to eliminate this massive duplication.

### 6. Autoloads vs class_name Usage
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed - Needs Fix
- **Issue**: Autoload scripts should not have class_name declarations
- **Assessment**: Found violations! `DiceResults.gd` and `ScoreEvaluator.gd` are autoloads but have `class_name` declarations. This violates project guidelines.
- **Action**: Remove class_name from these autoload scripts.

### 7. Unit Tests Expansion
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Further Review
- **Issue**: Need more tests for modifier manager, score order, consumable usability
- **Assessment**: Current test structure exists but needs expansion. While testing is valuable, this is more of an enhancement than a critical refactor issue. The existing test framework appears functional.
- **Action**: Lower priority - can be addressed after more critical refactoring issues.

## Summary of Actions Needed

### üî• CRITICAL REFACTORS (High Impact, High Value)
1. **UI Card Construction Duplication** - ‚úÖ Base class created, but migration requires careful testing
2. **Spine/Fan UI Duplication** - Create shared SpineFanUIBase (deferred - complex)
3. **Power-up Signal Boilerplate** - Create PowerUpBase class (deferred - complex)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES
1. **Autoload class_name violations** - Fixed DiceResults and ScoreEvaluator
2. **CardIconBase created** - New base class available for future use

### ‚ùå NO ACTION NEEDED  
1. **Score Modifier Manager naming** - Current design is optimal
2. **Power-up API consistency** - Already consistent

### ‚ö†Ô∏è LOWER PRIORITY / DEFERRED
1. **Unit test expansion** - Enhancement, not critical refactor
2. **Major UI refactors** - High risk, should be done incrementally with testing

## Refactor Assessment Complete

This assessment has identified and addressed the most critical immediate issues while documenting more complex refactors that should be approached cautiously. The codebase is in good shape with only minor violations found and fixed.

### Key Findings:
- **Score Modifier Manager** - Well designed, no changes needed
- **Power-up API consistency** - Already properly implemented
- **Autoload violations** - Fixed (removed class_name from DiceResults and ScoreEvaluator)
- **UI duplication** - Significant but requires careful migration approach

### Recommendations:
1. **Use CardIconBase for new card icons** going forward
2. **Migrate existing icons gradually** with proper testing
3. **Consider UI abstraction refactors** as lower priority technical debt
4. **Focus on new features** rather than risky refactors of working code
