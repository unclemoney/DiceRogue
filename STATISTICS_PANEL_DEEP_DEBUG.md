# Statistics Panel Deep Debug Guide

## Current Status
✅ **F10 Input Detection**: Working perfectly  
✅ **Panel Toggle Logic**: Working correctly  
❌ **Visual Rendering**: Panel not appearing despite being "visible"

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on the debug output, the issue is **NOT** with:
- Input handling (F10 is detected)
- Panel visibility state (correctly toggles true/false)
- Scene tree structure (StatisticsPanel exists)

The issue **IS** with:
- Visual rendering/positioning
- Possible scene layer conflicts
- Anchor/layout configuration issues

## Enhanced Debug Testing

### **Step 1: Run Enhanced Debug**
1. Run the game (DebuffTest.tscn)
2. Press F10 and note the NEW debug output:
   ```
   [StatisticsPanel] Initial z_index: 1000
   [StatisticsPanel] Initial size: (xxx, xxx)
   [StatisticsPanel] Panel position: (xxx, xxx)
   [StatisticsPanel] Panel global_position: (xxx, xxx)
   ```

### **Step 2: Force Visibility Test**
1. **Press F11** (new key binding I added)
2. This will force the panel to be bright yellow/red and positioned at (100,100)
3. If you see a bright yellow/red panel, the issue is positioning/styling
4. If you see nothing, the issue is deeper (scene layer conflicts)

### **Step 3: Manual Inspector Test**
1. While game is running, go to Godot's Scene dock
2. Find "StatisticsPanel" node in the running scene
3. In the Inspector, manually check "Visible" 
4. Observe if panel appears
5. Try changing "Position" to (0,0) manually

### **Step 4: Scene Tree Analysis**
Look for this debug output:
```
[GameController] Scene tree path to panel: NodePath("...")
[GameController] Panel's parent: Node2D
```

## Debugging Information to Collect

### **When you press F10, collect:**
1. All the position/size debug values
2. The z_index value  
3. The global_position coordinates
4. Whether Panel child is found

### **When you press F11, report:**
1. Do you see ANY bright yellow/red rectangle?
2. Where does it appear (what screen coordinates)?
3. Is it visible but empty, or completely invisible?

### **In Godot Inspector, check:**
1. StatisticsPanel node properties:
   - Layout → Anchors Preset
   - Layout → Position, Size  
   - Control → Modulate
   - CanvasItem → Z Index, Z As Relative
2. Panel child node properties (same checks)

## Likely Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Layout Mode Conflicts**
The .tscn file shows `layout_mode = 3` which might conflict with anchors.

**Test**: In Inspector, try changing:
- Layout Mode to "Anchor"
- Anchors Preset to "Full Rectangle"

### **Issue 2: Size Zero/Invalid**
Panel might have zero size due to layout conflicts.

**Test**: Manually set Panel child to:
- Position: (100, 100)  
- Size: (800, 600)

### **Issue 3: Z-Index Scene Layer**
Panel might be behind the CRT overlay or game canvas.

**Test**: Try setting z_index to 9999 in Inspector

### **Issue 4: Anchor Calculation Bug**
Center anchoring might be calculating wrong position.

**Test**: Change anchors to Top-Left (0,0,0,0) and set absolute position

## Expected F11 Behavior

When you press F11, you should see:
- A bright yellow Control panel
- With a bright red Panel child inside it
- Positioned at screen coordinates (100, 100)
- Size of 800x600 pixels

If you don't see this, the issue is fundamental rendering/scene hierarchy.

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Run the game and press F10** - collect ALL the new debug output
2. **Press F11** - report exactly what you see (or don't see)
3. **Check Inspector** - manually toggle visibility and report results
4. **Provide the debug output** - paste all the position/size values

## Quick Fix Attempts

If F11 test shows the panel but wrong position:
```gdscript
# In StatisticsPanel _ready(), add:
get_node("Panel").anchors_preset = Control.PRESET_CENTER
```

If F11 test shows nothing at all:
```gdscript
# In StatisticsPanel _ready(), add:
z_index = 9999
get_node("Panel").position = Vector2.ZERO
get_node("Panel").size = Vector2(800, 600)
```

## Next Steps
Run these tests and provide:
1. Complete debug output from F10 press
2. Results of F11 test (visual description)
3. Inspector values for StatisticsPanel and Panel child
4. Any errors in Godot console

This will pinpoint the exact cause of the rendering issue.
